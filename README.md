## 📄 Project Description  
This project demonstrates the creation of **interactive cards/boxes** that:  
- Expand when clicked  
- Show dropdowns for selecting **Size** and **Color**  
- Highlight the **Most Popular** plan with a zoom-in animation  
- Display a **popup message** when an item is added to the cart  

Built entirely from scratch using:  
- **HTML5** for structure  
- **CSS3** for styling and transitions  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** for interactivity
